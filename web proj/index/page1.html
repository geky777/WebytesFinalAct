            <h2>Arguments Against Animal Rights</h2>
            <p>While some people argue against animal rights for various reasons, common points include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Belief that animals lack moral status or inherent rights</li>
                <li>Economic concerns related to industries such as farming and research</li>
                <li>Claiming that humans have a superior position in the hierarchy of species</li>
                <li>Asserting that animals are resources for human use</li>
                <li> Animals lack the moral agency and rationality required to possess rights, as they cannot comprehend or respect moral principles.</li>
                <li>Granting animal rights would undermine human interests and freedoms, as it could restrict necessary activities such as agriculture, scientific research, and hunting.</li>
                <li>Animal rights could lead to economic hardships for industries dependent on animal use, such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and entertainment.</li>
                <li>Animal welfare regulations already exist to protect animals from unnecessary suffering, rendering additional rights unnecessary and burdensome.</li>
                <li>Prioritizing animal rights may divert resources and attention away from pressing human issues, such as poverty, healthcare, and education</li>
                <li>Granting animals rights could disrupt natural ecosystems and wildlife management practices, potentially leading to unintended consequences for biodiversity and conservation efforts</li>
            </ul>
