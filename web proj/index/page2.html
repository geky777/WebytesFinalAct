            <h2>What's the Difference Between Animal Welfare and Animal Rights?</h2>
            <p>Animal welfare and animal rights are related concepts but with distinct focuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong> Concerned with the well-being of animals and their humane treatment. It often involves regulations and standards to ensure proper care and prevent cruelty without necessarily granting animals inherent rights.
                    Its about making sure animals are treated kindly and taken care of properly. It means having rules and guidelines to make sure animals aren't hurt or mistreated. This doesn't always mean giving animals rights like humans, but it's
                    about making sure they have a good life. </li>
                <li><strong>Animal Rights:</strong> Advocates for granting animals certain basic rights, considering them as individuals with interests that should be respected. Animal rights go beyond welfare and aim to end practices that exploit or harm
                    animals.They see animals as individuals with feelings and needs that should be honored and protected. These rights go beyond just making sure animals are taken care of.

            <h2>Animal Abuse in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>Animal abuse is a serious issue that varies across regions. In the Philippines, some challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of comprehensive animal welfare laws and enforcement</li>
                <li>Concerns related to stray animals and inadequate care</li>
                <li>Issues with illegal animal fighting activities</li>
                <li>Dog fighting: Despite being illegal under the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, dog fighting continues to occur clandestinely in certain areas of the Philippines.</li>
                <li>Need for increased awareness and education on responsible pet ownership</li>
                <li>Neglect and abandonment: Many animals, particularly stray dogs and cats, are subjected to neglect and abandonment by their owners.</li>
            </ul>
